            Note that a successful fclose returns 0. Print out 
            the return value of fclose to confirm you are not closing an already closed file.
	    e.g. 

              int w=fclose(from);
              printf("w = %d \n", w);

            Notice, the return value may vary from one execution to the next because concurrent processes
            are not guaranteed to run in the same order each time.

	    Research Question: What if the child process closes the file with the above call to fclose when the 
            parent is still reading from it? 
            
            Answer: First look up "copy on write in fork", and then read
